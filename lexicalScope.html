               First off, JavaScript has lexical scoping with function scope. In
               other words, even though JavaScript looks like it should have
               block scope because it uses curly braces { }, a new scope is
               created only when you create a new function.
            </p>

               In this example, the variable x is available everywhere inside of
               outerFunction(). Also, the variable y is available everywhere
               within the nestedFunction(), but neither are available outside of
               the function where they were defined. The reason for this can be
               explained by lexical scoping. The scope of variables is defined
               by their position in source code. In order to resolve variables,
               JavaScript starts at the innermost scope and searches outwards
               until it finds the variable it was looking for. Lexical scoping
               is nice, because we can easily figure out what the value of a
               variable will be by looking at the code; whereas in dynamic
               scoping, the meaning of a variable can change at runtime, making
               it more difficult.
